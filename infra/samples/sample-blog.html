        <p>Building great APIs is both an art and a science. Here are 10 essential tips that will help you create APIs that developers love to use.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Design for Consistency</h2>
        <p>Use consistent naming conventions, error formats, and response structures across all endpoints. This makes your API predictable and easy to learn.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Version Your API</h2>
        <p>Always version your API from day one. Use URL versioning (v1, v2) or header-based versioning. Never break existing clients!</p>
        
        <h2>3. Provide Clear Documentation</h2>
        <p>Great docs are non-negotiable. Include examples, error codes, and interactive playgrounds. Consider using OpenAPI/Swagger.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Implement Rate Limiting</h2>
        <p>Protect your infrastructure with rate limits. Be generous but fair. Always return rate limit info in headers.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Use Proper HTTP Status Codes</h2>
        <p>200 for success, 201 for created, 400 for bad request, 401 for unauthorized, 404 for not found, 500 for server errors. Use them correctly!</p>
        
        <h2>6. Validate All Inputs</h2>
        <p>Never trust client data. Validate everything using schemas. Return detailed validation errors to help developers fix issues quickly.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Handle Errors Gracefully</h2>
        <p>Return helpful error messages with clear descriptions and suggestions for fixing the problem. Include error codes for programmatic handling.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Support Pagination</h2>
        <p>For list endpoints, always paginate results. Provide cursor-based or offset-based pagination with clear metadata.</p>
        
        <h2>9. Enable Filtering and Sorting</h2>
        <p>Let users filter and sort results using query parameters. This makes your API much more flexible and powerful.</p>
        
        <h2>10. Monitor and Measure</h2>
        <p>Track API usage, errors, and performance. Use this data to improve your API over time.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> Always provide example code in multiple languages. Nothing beats a good code example!</p>
