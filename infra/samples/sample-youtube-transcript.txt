Hey everyone! Today I'm going to show you the three biggest mistakes people make when starting their online business.

Mistake number one: trying to do everything yourself. You can't be the CEO, the developer, the marketer, and the customer support all at once. You need to delegate and build a team.

Mistake number two: not validating your idea before building. Too many entrepreneurs spend months building a product nobody wants. Talk to your customers first!

And mistake number three: giving up too early. Most successful businesses take 2-3 years to gain real traction. Stay consistent and keep improving.
